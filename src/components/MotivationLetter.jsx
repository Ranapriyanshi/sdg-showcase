                    My first lessons about gender were not taught in a classroom, but at home. I began noticing inequality in small, everyday moments, when my brother was free to focus on his studies while I was asked to prepare tea, help in the kitchen, and be "responsible" for household duties simply because I was a girl. I did not understand why the expectations placed on me were different, only that they felt unfair. I was not born with a sense of what it meant to be "a girl" or what society expected of one. Like every child, I was born curious, fearless, and equal. It was only as I grew up in Haryana, India, a region where gender roles are deeply rooted, that I was taught what I should and should not be, simply because of my gender. I never fit comfortably into those boundaries. I questioned them, resisted them, and slowly began to understand that the discomfort I felt was not because something was wrong with me, but because the world around me had placed limits on who I was allowed to become.

                    That realization led me to education, to technology, and to the belief that knowledge and opportunity are the greatest tools for freedom. As a Computer Science student, I see technology not just as code or systems, but as a powerful equalizer. Digital platforms, data, and innovation can reduce social and economic gaps and give people, especially women, the ability to claim their own voices.

                    My mother teaches at a school having a lot of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and through her, I regularly visit to conduct creative activities, learning sessions, and festival celebrations. These moments remind children that they matter, that their dreams are valid, and that education can open doors no matter where they begin. Watching their confidence grow has strengthened my commitment to building a more inclusive future.

                    My advocacy is also deeply personal. I have faced gender bias and inappropriate behavior in academic and professional spaces. Those experiences were painful, but they taught me something essential, silence protects injustice, while voice creates change. That is why I speak openly about gender equality and inclusive workplaces on LinkedIn, where more than <strong>2,000 people</strong> engage with my ideas. I use this platform to challenge harmful norms and encourage young professionals to imagine better, fairer systems.

                    I have also participated in technology outreach programs through my university, helping students develop digital skills and confidence, ensuring they do not feel excluded from the world of innovation. These efforts align closely with my long-term goal of becoming a technology-driven changemaker who expands access to education, skills, and opportunity for young people, especially women. The Future Action Summit Australia represents a chance to grow beyond my borders. As a student from a middle-class Indian family, such global exposure is financially difficult yet deeply transformative. I will bring back not only knowledge and networks, but the strength to keep questioning, speaking up, and building spaces where every young person can belong.
